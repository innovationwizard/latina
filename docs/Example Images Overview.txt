Example Images Overview
The images depict excerpts from a spreadsheet (likely Google Sheets or Excel) focused on furniture design, costing, and specifications for a home or interior project. Content is in Spanish and covers items for rooms like dining (comedor), living (sala principal, sala familiar), bedroom (dormitorio), and others. Data is organized in tables with two main types: costing/pricing tables (including quantities, unit costs, totals, IVA-inclusive prices, and profits) and specification tables (dimensions, materials, and notes). Visuals include embedded photos of furniture items. This structure supports quotation automation by standardizing data extraction for calculations like total costs, margins, and specs.
Below, I categorize the distinct kinds of information, with examples from the images. Categories are derived directly from recurring patterns across all tables. No assumptions made; all based on visible data.
1. Item Identification and Grouping

Description: High-level labels grouping furniture by type, room, or option. Includes headers like "SILLAS OPCION 1" (Chairs Option 1), "BUTACAS OPCION 2" (Armchairs Option 2), "MESA DE COMEDOR" (Dining Table), "COSTEO" (Costing), and room-specific sections like "Sala principal" (Main Living Room), "Comedor" (Dining Room).
Purpose for Automation: Serves as keys for categorizing quotes (e.g., filter by room or variant).
Examples:
"SILLAS OPCION 1" with sub-items like "TELA" (Fabric).
"BACK LATERAL SOFA" under sofa components.
Room labels: "Sala familiar" (Family Room), "Dormitorio" (Bedroom).


2. Pricing and Cost Data

Description: Numerical data on unit costs, quantities, totals, IVA (tax)-inclusive prices, and utility (profit margins). Formats include raw costs, calculated totals, and summaries. Currency implied as local (e.g., Chilean pesos based on values like 1,800).
Purpose for Automation: Core for quote generation; enables summing totals, applying taxes (IVA), and calculating profits.
Examples:
Unit price: "PRECIO" columns, e.g., 1,800 for "SILLAS OPCION 1".
Quantity: Columns like quantity multipliers, e.g., 1.5 for "TELA", 60 for total units.
Totals: "TOTAL" rows, e.g., 1,900.00 for a chair option.
IVA-inclusive: "PRECIO CON IVA", e.g., 2,857.68 for a bench.
Profit: "UTILIDAD", e.g., 681.50 for a chair set.
Aggregates: Full item totals like 9,280.00 for "MUEBLE STORAGE".


3. Dimensional Specifications

Description: Measurements for length (largo), height (alto), depth (profundidad), and other metrics like diameter or roll quantities. Units in meters (m) or counts (e.g., rolls). Often tied to specific items or spaces.
Purpose for Automation: Essential for custom quotes; integrate with design tools for feasibility checks or scaling costs.
Examples:
"Largo": 6.95m for "Papel Tapiz" (Wallpaper), 2m for "Cama King" (King Bed).
"Alto": 2.40m for wallpaper, 0.90m for a sofa.
"Profundidad": None or "no tiene" (none) for some, 0.75m for armchairs.
Specialized: "Cantidad de rollos" (Number of rolls): 4 for wallpaper; "Diametro base" (Base diameter): 0.75m for dining table.


4. Material and Construction Details

Description: Lists of materials, finishes, and important notes (datos importantes). Includes fabrics, woods, metals, and custom instructions.
Purpose for Automation: For supplier integration or cost variability; tag for sourcing or allergen checks in quotes.
Examples:
Materials: "Melamina chocolate, gris, jaladores en dorado" (Chocolate melamine, gray, gold handles) for nightstand; "Tela a elegir" (Fabric to choose) for sofas.
Notes: "El cliente NO quiere el back como tal, se le ofrece pintur con moldura" (Client doesn't want the back as is, offer paint with molding); "Son dos unidades, son dos gavetas" (Two units, two drawers).
Components: "Corte y Canto" (Cut and Edge), "Mano de Obra Latina" (Latin Labor), "Ferreteria" (Hardware).


5. Visual References

Description: Embedded photos or renders of furniture items, placed alongside tables. No text overlays; purely illustrative.
Purpose for Automation: Link to image URLs or databases for quote PDFs; enhance client presentations without manual attachment.
Examples:
Images of chairs (sillas), sofas, tables, rugs (alfombra), beds (cama), storage units.
Positioned next to specs, e.g., photo of "Mesa de Comedor" (Dining Table) showing marble top and wooden base.


6. Calculation and Summary Elements

Description: Derived values like subtotals, grand totals, and blank/zero placeholders. Includes formulas implied (e.g., total = quantity * unit price).
Purpose for Automation: Automate with scripts (e.g., Python/Pandas for sums); validate data integrity.
Examples:
Subtotals: "TOTAL" for sections, e.g., 2,800.00 for dining table top + base.
Grand summaries: Overall "PRECIO CON IVA" like 4,444.16 for armchairs.
Zeros/Blanks: Common in unused rows, e.g., 0.00 for some hardware costs.


Recommendations for Automation

Data Structure: Model as JSON/CSV with keys for category, item_name, dimensions (dict), costs (dict), materials (list), notes (string).
