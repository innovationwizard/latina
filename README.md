## ⚠️ CRITICAL: READ CLIENT FEEDBACK

**Before making any changes to image enhancement features, READ:**

1. Participants and Context

Valeria (co-founder of Latina Interiors) explains the company’s workflow and pain points.

Jorge Luis (AI adoption strategist) presents possible AI and tech-based solutions.

Diego acts as collaborator familiar with both sides.

The meeting’s purpose: explore how AI and process automation can help Latina Interiors improve efficiency and scalability.

2. Company Overview

Latina Interiors: Interior design and furniture manufacturing firm (≈9 years old).

Team: Two architect founders (both now mothers), small workshop.

Operations: Highly manual and “artisanal”, relying heavily on WhatsApp, Google Drive, and paper-based processes.

Challenges:

Fragmented communication and information transfer.

Lack of systemized workflow across design, production, and client management.

Difficulty hiring proactive and committed staff.

Resistance to complex software (e.g., Monday, Odoo felt too cumbersome).

3. Current Workflow

	A. Lead generation via Instagram → manual WhatsApp response.

	B. Design inquiry: client selects one of two services: space design or furniture design.

	C. Scheduling: manually coordinated visits.

	D. Site visit: team measures and takes photos (manual notes, laser tape).

	E. Design phase:

		E1. Drawings in Rhino or SketchUp

		E2. Renders in Cinema + Photoshop.

		E3. Attempts to enhance visuals using ChatGPT image editing (time-consuming).

		E4. Presentation assembled in Canva for client review.

	F. Client review: video calls or chat feedback, up to 3 revision rounds.

	G. Quotation: only after design is finalized — done manually in Excel.

	H. Technical drawings: separate “drawing” team redrafts designs into production blueprints (duplicate work).

	I. Manufacturing & installation: manual workshop process, frequent rework due to measurement errors.

4. Pain Points Identified

No automation for repetitive tasks (responses, quoting, information capture).

Data loss and duplication between design, drawing, and production.

Render quality inconsistent; AI tools (ChatGPT, MyArchitect) unreliable or hard to control consistency of output.

Quoting consumes too much manual time and lacks standardization.

Design process slow and inconsistent between designers.

No modular catalog—every project starts from scratch.

Inefficient information transfer from client to design to production.

Massive data bloat on phones (60+ GB of WhatsApp media).

5. AI & Automation Opportunities

Quick wins (immediate value):

AI-assisted renders – use better tools (Midjourney, MyArchitect, or fine-tuned AI pipeline).

Automated note-taking – use Otter or similar iPhone transcription apps to summarize meetings and auto-upload to Drive.

Automatic quoting – prototype “Smart Quote Calculator” using standardized materials and dimensions.

3D room scanning – adopt MagicPlan app or similar with iPhone’s LiDAR to capture space dimensions in minutes.

Build internal AI-based assistant for quoting, material tracking, and FAQs.

Medium-term:

Develop semi-modular product library (e.g., fixed dimensions and components).

Standardize design assets and textures for consistent output.

Long-term (AI vision):

Integrate 3D scanning → automatic room modeling → AI-assisted layout proposal in seconds.

Machine learning models learn Latina’s design “style” to auto-generate proposals.

Full “design personalization illusion”: standardized components presented as unique designs to each client.

6. Next Steps Agreed

Valeria to send Jorge:

Example renders (before/after with ChatGPT).

Example quotations (Excel or Sheets).

Jorge to:

Prototype render improvement workflow.

Explore quoting automation logic.

Prepare plan for semi-modular design system.

7. Tone & Dynamics

Friendly, informal, yet focused on concrete implementation.

Valeria open to AI despite past skepticism.

Jorge enthusiastic about automation and confident in execution.

Diego plays practical bridge role.

8. Key Deliverables Expected

Short-term: functional render-improvement pipeline + quote calculator demo.

Mid-term: process automation for meeting notes and design information sync.

Long-term: AI design assistant trained on Latina’s historical projects.
